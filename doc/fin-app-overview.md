- **No ads disguised as advice** – no pushing credit cards or consolidation loans.
- **Privacy-first architecture** – e.g., Plaid Portal allows you to revoke access anytime.

If you’re designing or choosing an app, start with **automated transaction import + envelope budgeting + bill reminders** — that already covers 80% of user needs. Add receipt capture, goals, and reports for the remaining 20%.
